# Haskell-DiffEqs
Simple homogeneous differential equation approximator for Haskell, in case anyone else doesn't really feel like doing their DiffEq homework :P

Currently only implements first-order Runge-Kutta method (Euler's method) and second-order Runge-Kutta method. Not sure how this will evolve in the future; fluid simulations seem enticing.
