# Haskell-DiffEqs
Simple homogeneous differential equation approximator for Haskell.

Why do your DiffEq homework when you can write a program that does your DiffEq homework?

Currently only implements first-order Runge-Kutta method (Euler's method) and second-order Runge-Kutta method. Not sure how this will evolve in the future.
