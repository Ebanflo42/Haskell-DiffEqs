# Haskell-DiffEqs
Simple homogeneous differential equation approximator for Haskell.

Why JUST do your DiffEq homework when you can also write a program that does your DiffEq homework? :P

Currently only implements first-order Runge-Kutta method (Euler's method) and second-order Runge-Kutta method. Not sure how this will evolve in the future. Learning about fluid simulations is enticing.
